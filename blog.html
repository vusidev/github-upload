<h2>Motivation art stories</h2>
<p>Nancy Rodrigo: Be creative in your work by keeping an open mind to everything around you, allow that flexibility to inform your ability to sustain your practice by always cultivating a healthy network of friends, colleagues and peers. Being an artist means having a responsibility to your practice, nurture that! Being a professional artist means being reliable, even tempered, diplomatic and most of all learning to be an effective entrepreneur. Always keep learning, an artist is constantly learning. This is not a sprint, this is a marathon, till your last breath, forget about destination and focus on the path and journey.</p>

<p>Jane Zamost: I've actually thought about this question quite often. When I graduated as a fine arts major back in 1980, every professor geared us to get involved with competitions and keep painting but they didn’t give us the know-how to make money for the materials and expenses involved with the competitions. Instead, we were encouraged to work in graphic design or outside of the art world. Why didn’t anyone tell us to go work for an established artist and learn both the craft and the business? That’s my opinion – work for an artist that is producing art and making money at creating. Hone your craft, understand the art business.</p>

<p>Diane Novetsky: Don't focus on becoming an art star and getting into the right galleries. The New Paradigm of the art world will be very different–and you'll have to create your own opportunities.</p>

<p>Carter Hammond: I'd pass on the only real piece of advice I got and took to heart. ‘If you want to be a professional artist, you’re going to have to work at it every day.’ I’d also tell them from my own experience, work in an art gallery for some time so you can learn more about the business of art and meet artists who are making a living by making art.</p>

<p>Lou Jordan: Remember creating art is a skill. And like any skill it has to be practiced. The more you practice the better you get.So do your best to practice every day as even a little bit. 15 minutes of drawing or working with color or shape will improve your skills and your art enormously.</p>
</div>
<div class="text-block">
<p>Heather LuAnn: Learn as much as you can, challenge yourself and always be your own worst critic. Look at artists work, politics, contemporary art, and past history. Be open to learning new things daily. Allow your work to evolve. If you truly love creating you will feel restless and unhappy when you don't, so…create.</p>
